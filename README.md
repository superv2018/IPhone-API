# IPhone-API
This API is to displays different Iphone model and their description. The data is stored in a POSTGRESQL database and the API is built with TypeScript, Express on NODE environment.

My goal is to build this API using SQL for queries instead of using ORM. The idea is to learn how RAW SQL is used to fetch data from the database before jumping to ORM abstraction.

To run this program:
1. Make sure you have POSTGRESQL installed on your machine. 
2. Make sure you have NODE installed on your machine.
3. Clone the respository to your local machine.
4. Run npm install, to install all dependencies.
5. Run npm start to run the application.
